# aps-2026-poster-feeding-ecology
All the data tables and Python code used in the Principal Component Analysis performed in the investigation of the feeding ecology of dinosaurs from the upper Dinosaur Park formation. 

All Python code was written in a Juypter Notebook. It should be noted that Claude AI was used to debug and make suggestions on the code, and the code for the PERMANOVA was fully written using Claude. 
I would like to thank Samuel Kahessey for his help in the coding for this project.
